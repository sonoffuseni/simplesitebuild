This is a simple static website that I built as part of a homework for Leon Noel's 100Devs class.

In this homework I : 
1. Built the HTML structure of the website.
2. Explored and implemented relationships between elements
when styling in CSS.
3. Explored the uses of the box model.
4. Used flex-box.
